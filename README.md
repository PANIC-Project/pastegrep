## Pastegrep ##

This project was created of an evening with the intent to make it easy to watch
pastebin for a given keyword and cache the result.  It's written in python and
designed to be easily used as a module.  With very little work you should be
able to import a function from pastegrep, pass it an expression you want to
watch for, and optionally give it a function to call whenever it finds a paste
that matches your regular expression.
